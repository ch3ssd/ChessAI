# ChessAI

ChessAI is a project focused on training a machine learning model to identify chess pieces and their positions based on images of a chessboard. The goal is to recognize various chess pieces and their locations on the board, enabling potential applications such as computer vision-based chess games or automated chess move detection.

This project will be developed iteratively and delivered in phases.

## Phases
1. Train the AI to recognize individual chess pieces from images.
2. Train the AI to identify the position of a single chess piece on the chessboard from images.
3. Train the AI to identify multiple chess pieces and their positions on the chessboard from images.

## Description

This project leverages computer vision and deep learning to classify chess pieces from images of a chessboard. The model is trained to distinguish between various chess pieces such as pawns, knights, rooks, bishops, queens, and kings, as well as identify their colors (white or black).

The project uses frameworks like **PyTorch** and **FastAI** to preprocess the images and train the model. The input consists of chessboard images, and the output will be predictions of the piece type and its color.
